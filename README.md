# Computational-Logic-Modeling-and-Transport-Analysis-of-Graphene-Based-Nanotransistors-
A theoretical review and computational study of Graphene Field-Effect Transistors (GFETs). This repository hosts a comparative analysis of sub-threshold swing, 1/f noise mitigation, and the implementation of 2D-material-based logic gates as alternatives to traditional Silicon CMOS technology.
