# Computational Logic Modeling and Transport Analysis of Graphene-Based Nanotransistors

## Overview
This repository hosts a theoretical review and computational study of **Graphene Field-Effect Transistors (GFETs)**. As Silicon CMOS technology approaches its physical scaling limits, 2D materials like Graphene offer a promising path forward.

## Research Objectives
* **Sub-threshold Swing Analysis:** Investigating the limits of switching efficiency.
* **1/f Noise Mitigation:** Analyzing techniques to reduce low-frequency noise in carbon-based devices.
* **Logic Gate Implementation:** Modeling the feasibility of Graphene-based NAND/NOR architectures.

## Tools Used
* **Python:** For data simulation and plotting.
* **MySQL:** For structured storage of device parameters and research data.

## Visualizations
